plainbox-provider-checkbox (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. List of bugfixes:
    https://launchpad.net/plainbox-provider-checkbox/14.04/0.4
  * debian/watch: look for new releases on launchpad
  * debian/rules: stop using pybuild and use manage.py
    {i18n,build,install,validate} instead. This also drops dependency on
    python3-distutils-extra and replaces that with intltool
  * debian/control: drop X-Python3-Version
  * debian/control: make plainbox-provider-checkbox depend on python and
    python2.7 (for some scripts) rather than suggesting them.
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: Use armoured gpg keys to avoid having to
    keep binary files in Debian packaging. Also, replace that with my key
    since I made the 0.3 release upstream.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides: add an override for warning about no
    source for flash movie with reference to a bug report that discusses that
    issue.
  * debian/source/include-binaries: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/patches: drop (no longer needed)
  * debian/plainbox-provider-checkbox.lintian-overrides: drop (no longer
    needed)
  * Stop being a python3 module, move to from DPMT to PAPT
